//! Aho-Corasick redaction at the persistence boundary (§6.7): a live secret value, once
//! it appears anywhere in an event payload, must never physically reach the SQLite
//! `events.payload` column. Redaction runs inside `writer::append_one`/`append_batch`,
//! BEFORE `serialize_payload` — the stored row is always the already-redacted form, never
//! the original.
//!
//! `EventWriter` holds a hot-swappable `Redactor` (`arc_swap::ArcSwap`, see `writer.rs`)
//! so the live secret-value list can be updated without restarting the writer task or
//! interrupting in-flight appends.
